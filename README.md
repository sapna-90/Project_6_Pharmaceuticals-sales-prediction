Pharmaceuticals-sales-prediction       
This project focuses mainly on forecasting daily sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' stores across various cities.  
Our goal is to develop a predictive model to assist the finance team in making sales forecasts.      
The main factors that influence sales include promotions, holidays, and seasonality.     
**Data Exploration:** Analyze sales trends, holiday effects, promotions, and competitor impact.   
**Preprocessing**: Clean data, handling missing values, outliers and generating features such as weekdays and holiday proximities.   
**Modeling**: Implement regression models and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.      
**Deployment**: Serve predictions via a web dashboard, allowing store managers to input parameters and obtain forecasts.
